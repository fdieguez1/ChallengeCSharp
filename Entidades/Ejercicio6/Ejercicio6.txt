a) 
A collection generated using LINQ differs in a collection generated normally on its execution, LINQ to objects (Used for querying local in-memory collections) methods are executed in a deferred way, meaning that the code is executed when we retrieve the result, or iterate through the query. This happen for methods of LINQ that return objects of type IEnumerable<T>, this does not happen with methods that return a scalar value since the last ones are simpler and executed immediately when the query is defined.
